## New Years with a Bang ##

In starting with the new years we have created an Android application for everyone to use.

Android users will now be able to keep up to date on events, order programming books, and read FreeCodeCamp Dallas articles at lightning speed anywhere they take their Android device.

New features will be released through out the coming months.
